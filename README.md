### My First Web Development Project

This unfinished project was my first attempt at web development during high school. It captures my early stories and memories with OI (Olympiad in Informatics). 

Despite the bumps along the way, I'm grateful that I still love programming, and now I'm slowly making my way back to this path.

Looking back, I would love to tell my younger self: "You made it this far, and you're just getting started."
